**Energy Demand Forecasting**

### Intro

Understanding demand for electricity is important when developing approaches to reduce emissions from electricity.
Renewable energy sources are usually intermittant and electricity generation does not always align with demand. 
Better understanding demand can help to inform approaches to optimise the inclusion of renewable energy sources in the grid.

This project investigates forecasting of energy demand using historical energy demand data. 

### Data Source

The data used is freely available at: 

https://demandforecast.nationalgrid.com/efs_demand_forecast/faces/DataExplorer%3bjsessionid=DIGLrqrEtLaANPmsBwXpDsup6nAnmohXcyVEJpxzdiCZZWNw5IvC%211040504046

The separate files DemandData_2020, DemandData_2019, DemandData_2018, DemandData_2017 are used.


### Forecast

The forecast is completed using the Facebook Prophet forecasting package.
